# Soccer Video Processing Pipeline

> **First time? Start here: [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** — a step-by-step guide that gets you from zero to your first goalkeeper reel.

> **Intended use:** This software is designed for youth and amateur soccer analytics and personal experimentation. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or approved by any professional league, federation, or governing body.

Agent-based system that processes 4K soccer match recordings from a NAS and automatically produces:

- **Goalkeeper Reel** — every GK action (saves, distribution, one-on-ones)
- **Highlights Reel** — shots, goals, near-misses, great plays
- **Player Reel** *(Phase 2)* — on-demand reel for any outfield player

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Deploy (auto-detects NVIDIA GPU / Apple MPS / CPU, generates .env, starts stack)
make deploy
# or non-interactive: infra/scripts/setup.sh /mnt/nas/soccer /mnt/nas/output

# 2. Submit a match for processing
python infra/scripts/pipeline_cli.py submit matches/game_2025_01_15.mp4

# 3. Monitor progress
python infra/scripts/pipeline_cli.py status <job_id> --watch
open http://localhost:8080/ui   # Web dashboard

# 4. List all jobs
python infra/scripts/pipeline_cli.py list
```

### Deployment Modes

`make deploy` auto-detects hardware and picks the right mode:

| Mode | Hardware | Stack |
|------|----------|-------|
| **NVIDIA** | Linux + CUDA GPUs | Full Docker with GPU passthrough |
| **MPS** | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | Redis in Docker, worker + API run natively |
| **CPU** | Fallback | Full Docker, CPU-only inference |

## Agent System

This project uses Claude Code's multi-agent architecture. Each subdirectory under `agents/` is an independent agent with its own `CLAUDE.md` context:

| Agent | `cd` command | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Architect | `cd agents/architect` | System design, ADRs, interface contracts |
| Developer | `cd agents/developer` | All source code in `src/` |
| SDET | `cd agents/sdet` | Tests, CI, quality gates |
| Video Analyst | `cd agents/video-analyst` | CV/ML models, event taxonomy |
| Pipeline Operator | `cd agents/pipeline-operator` | Infra, deployment, monitoring |

## Development

```bash
make setup              # Install Python deps
make deploy             # Auto-detect hardware, generate .env, start stack
make generate-fixtures  # Create synthetic test videos
make test-unit          # Fast tests, no infra needed
make test-integration   # Requires Docker
make check-nas          # Verify NAS connectivity
make check-gpu          # Verify NVIDIA GPU + container toolkit
```

```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Streaming-first**: Video never fully loaded into RAM
- **Idempotent**: Re-processing same file = identical output
- **GPU-optional**: NVIDIA CUDA, Apple MPS, or CPU — auto-detected at deploy time
- **NAS-safe**: Source files never modified

See `docs/architecture.md` (generated by Architect agent) for full design.
